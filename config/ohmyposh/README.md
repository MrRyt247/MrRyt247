NB: If you cannot find AppData folder, enable show Hidden Items. If persistent, type %appdata% in the address bar, change directory back to AppData and proceed with navigation.

For more terminal customizations, proceed to install Terminal icons [here](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons "Terminal Icons GitHub repo")!

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Terminal Icons

*Terminal-Icons* is a PowerShell module that adds file and folder icons when displaying items in the terminal. This relies on the custom fonts provided by [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

For further PowerShell customizations, proceed to install PSReadline [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine "PSReadline GitHub Repo")!

## üìù PSReadline

This module replaces the command line editing experience of PowerShell for versions 3 and up. It provides *Syntax coloring, *Simple syntax error notification*, *A good multi-line experience (both editing and history),* and a lot more.

I recommend John Savill's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q11sSltuTE0) (2021) covering installation, configuration, and tailoring PSReadLine to your liking.
